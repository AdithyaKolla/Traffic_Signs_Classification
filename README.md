# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
## Dataset:
The dataset is fetched from official Website of INI benchmark website
https://sid.erda.dk/public/archives/daaeac0d7ce1152aea9b61d9f1e19370/published-archive.html
### About the Dataset:  
The Dataset is German Traffic Sign Benchmark consists of approximately 50,000 images and 43 classes.  
Based on the data, This project comes under the category of multi-class, single-image classification problem.
## Motivation

### Driver Support Systems
It can be a support to automatically limit the speed of the vehicle,
send a warning signal indicating overspeed, warn or limit illegal
manuever or indicate earlier the presence of the sign to the driver.

### Highway maintenance

Nowadays, a human operator has to watch a videotape to check the
presence and condition of the signs. It is a tedious task because the
signs appear from time to time, and because the operator has to pay
great attention.
## Summary
1. The images are passed to a Deep Learning model, adopting a  
DCNN Net (Deep Convolutional Neural
Network/ ConvNet ) implemented
using TensorFlow.
2. For processing of image data one has to use Deep learning model and
TensorFlow is widely used today for image recognition applications.

3. So it makes sense to use DCNN using PyTorch.

4. The Research paper proposed a Deep Convolutional Neural network
Choosing the appropriate CNN model with no of hidden layers will
help in getting high accurate results
